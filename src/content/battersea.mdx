Battersea Power Station's redevelopment transformed one of London's most iconic industrial landmarks into a mixed-use destination combining residential, retail, and cultural programming. The Experience Room served as interpretive space within the development, providing visitors with context about the building's architectural heritage and its transformation. We led real-time interactive application development in Unity for large-format exhibition content as part of the broader creative team, coordinating delivery through the agency and client approval chain.

The challenge centered on multi-stakeholder coordination under immovable deadlines tied to the site's public opening. Large-format exhibition contexts demand specific technical considerations—resolution requirements, codec specifications, color calibration for venue lighting conditions, seamless looping behavior, and playback performance constraints. Each deliverable required approval across multiple organizational layers (client, agency, studio) while maintaining production momentum. The timeline compression left minimal room for iteration; technical decisions required confidence before committing to full-resolution rendering.

We structured the production pipeline to eliminate approval bottlenecks while maintaining quality control across distributed contributors. Regular stakeholder reviews maintained alignment without introducing decision latency. Pipeline choices prioritized hitting venue playback targets—file formats, compression strategies, and quality assurance protocols designed specifically for the exhibition hardware and viewing conditions.

The content shipped on schedule and to specification, installed as part of the Experience Room within the public redevelopment. The project demonstrated capability to navigate complex organizational structures while maintaining technical precision under compressed timelines—operating simultaneously across creative oversight, technical production management, and multi-party coordination without the friction that typically emerges when these functions remain siloed.
