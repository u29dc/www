Wallpaper\* and Porsche GB commissioned a short film for Porsche's 75th anniversary, interpreting Ferry Porsche's founding vision through abstract digital narrative. The commission came through Lusion, with whom we executed the full production. The timeline was unforgiving: two and a half weeks from concept to delivery for installation at Outernet London—a monumental public art venue featuring wraparound LED architecture across five surfaces (top screen plus four surrounding walls) forming an immersive cube environment in central London's theatre district.

The creative brief centered on Ferry Porsche's foundational quote: "In the beginning I looked around and could not find the dream car I dreamed of, so I decided to build it myself." We developed a narrative structure moving from abstract to concrete—luminous particles converging into the Porsche crest, energy coalescing into form, a seed emerging and blossoming into floral elements that gradually reveal the silhouettes of iconic Porsche models from the marque's seven-decade lineage. The concept required balancing Porsche's engineering precision with organic beauty, translating the founder's vision into motion without literalism.

We established the visual language and narrative structure within the first three days through rapid storyboarding and a rough assembly edit, securing client approval to proceed with parallel production. The core challenge wasn't creative vision—it was coordinating distributed technical execution across time zones under extreme time compression. We recruited two specialist CG artists, one US-based and one in Asia, creating a continuous production cycle. The US artist advanced scene development overnight (UK time), progressing Houdini particle systems, preliminary lighting setups, and scene architecture. We inherited those files each morning, focusing on look development, lighting refinement, render pipeline optimization, and technical problem-solving throughout the day. Evening briefings with both artists defined the next cycle's priorities and scene assignments, maintaining momentum across the 24-hour cycle.

Render time and iteration constraints created the primary bottleneck. We couldn't afford unlimited preview iterations; decisions required confidence before committing to full-resolution renders. We deployed a custom render farm with centralized management systems, coordinating render job distribution, monitoring for crashes and errors, and maintaining strict version control across three contributors working in the same scene files. The Outernet format demanded specific technical considerations—not cylindrical projection but direct cube mapping across the five-surface architecture, requiring careful composition testing to ensure visual coherence across screen boundaries and proper scale relationships for viewers moving through the physical space.

The work operated simultaneously across multiple domains that typically remain siloed. We defined the creative direction and aesthetic language while managing the technical rendering infrastructure, coordinating remote team workflows across incompatible time zones, troubleshooting Houdini procedural systems, and delivering against unusual format specifications with limited testing opportunities. Traditional production structures separate these functions—creative directors focus on vision, technical directors manage pipelines, producers coordinate teams. That specialization introduces communication overhead and decision latency that becomes fatal under compressed timelines. The project succeeded not through heroic effort but through systematic workflow design that eliminated handoff delays, enabling rapid decision-making across creative and technical dimensions without organizational friction.
